This app aims to solve the problem of students and visitors struggling to find the right campus shuttle or \"trotro\" routes. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Interactive Map:** A map of the University of Ghana campus with marked shuttle and \"trotro\" routes. Users should be able to zoom and pan to explore the map.\n-   **Route Information:** Display route details when a user selects a specific route on the map, including stops, estimated travel time, and fare information.\n-   **Search Functionality:** Allow users to search for specific locations or buildings on campus and find the best routes to reach them.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#585858` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#00308F` (University of Ghana Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#FFD700` (University of Ghana Gold)\n    *   Accent: `#4CAF50` (Green, for positive actions like route confirmation)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E0E0E0` (Light Gray)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for readability and a professional look.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Implement the interactive map using a suitable mapping library (e.g., `react-native-maps`). Display the map of the University of Ghana campus.\n    *   Add functionality to display shuttle and \"trotro\" routes on the map. This might involve fetching route data from a local file or (ideally) a Supabase database.\n    *   Implement the search functionality to allow users to find locations on the map.\n2.  **Create a new component for Route Information:**\n    *   Create a new file in the `components` folder called `RouteInfo.tsx`.\n    *   This component will display detailed information about a selected route, including stops, estimated travel time, and fare.\n    *   The component should receive route data as props.\n3.  **Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Ensure the tab bar is visible and functional for navigation between the map, profile, and any other screens.\n4.  **Remove `modalDemos` array:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not needed for the core functionality of the app.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user. After that, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-01T19:15:28.271332"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the Interactive Campus Map App for the University of Ghana.

I've successfully implemented the Interactive Campus Map App for the University of Ghana. Here's what I've created:\n\n## **Key Features Implemented:**\n\n### **1. Interactive Campus Map Interface**\n- **Map Placeholder**: Since react-native-maps isn't supported in Natively, I created a placeholder that clearly explains this limitation while showing what features would be available\n- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for routes and campus locations\n- **Route Display**: All campus shuttle and trotro routes are displayed with detailed information\n\n### **2. University of Ghana Branding**\n- **Colors**: Implemented the official UG colors:\n  - Primary: `#00308F` (University Blue)\n  - Secondary: `#FFD700` (University Gold)  \n  - Accent: `#4CAF50` (Green for confirmations)\n  - Clean, professional color scheme throughout\n\n### **3. Route Information System**\n- **Detailed Route Cards**: Each route shows fare, duration, frequency, and type\n- **Route Details Modal**: Comprehensive information including:\n  - All stops with estimated times\n  - Operating hours\n  - Fare information\n  - Route confirmation functionality\n\n### **4. Sample Data**\n- **5 Routes**: Including campus shuttles and trotro routes\n- **15 Campus Locations**: Major buildings, halls, and landmarks\n- **Realistic Data**: Actual UG locations like Great Hall, Balme Library, Commonwealth Hall, etc.\n\n### **5. Modern UI/UX**\n- **Clean Design**: Breathable layout with proper spacing\n- **Search Integration**: Real-time filtering of routes and locations\n- **Smooth Animations**: Using React Native Reanimated\n- **Responsive Layout**: Works on both iOS and Android\n\n### **6. Navigation Structure**\n- **Tab-based Navigation**: Map and Profile screens\n- **Floating Tab Bar**: Custom implementation for Android/Web\n- **Native Tabs**: iOS-specific implementation\n\n### **Files Created/Modified:**\n\n1. **`styles/commonStyles.ts`** - University of Ghana color scheme and common styles\n2. **`components/RouteInfo.tsx`** - Detailed route information modal\n3. **`components/MapPlaceholder.tsx`** - Map placeholder with feature preview\n4. **`data/routeData.ts`** - Sample route and location data\n5. **`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`** - Main campus navigator interface\n6. **`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`** - User profile with travel stats\n7. **`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`** - Updated tab navigation\n8. **`components/FloatingTabBar.tsx`** - Updated with new colors\n\nThe app now provides a comprehensive campus navigation solution that helps students and visitors find the right shuttle or trotro routes, view fare information, and navigate the University of Ghana campus efficiently. The interface is intuitive, branded appropriately, and ready for future enhancements like real-time tracking and route optimization."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-01T19:15:18Z"}]
